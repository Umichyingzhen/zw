Hi! I’m **Yingzhen Wang**, a graduate student in Biostatistics at the University of Michigan.  
I’m passionate about computational statistics, data science, and biostatistical applications, with a strong background in statistical modeling, data visualization, and real-world meidcal data analysis.

### 🎓 Education
- **M.S. in Biostatistics**, University of Michigan *(August 2024 - Expected May 2026)*
- **M.A.S. in Statistical Science**, Colorado State University *(Aug 2020 - Aug 2022)*
- **B.S. in Statistics**, Yanbian University *(Sep 2016 - Jun 2020)*

### 🔬 Research Interests
- Computational statistics & bioinformatics  
- Clinical trials 
- Data visualization  
- Differential gene expression detection  
- Applied medical data analysis and statistical consulting  

### 💼 Experience
I have worked on projects in large language models, Bayesian modeling, and Alzheimer’s disease gene expression, including developing elliptical slice sampling algorithms and the Multivariate Bayesian Shrinkage Prior (Mt-MBSP) model for mixed-type outcomes.
I also have experience in applying advanced statistical and machine learning methods to biomedical research and medical data, such as spatial transcriptomics analysis with SPADE and BASS, predictive algorithms for cardiovascular disease, radiation effect modeling in mice, and diffusion/CLIP models for medical imaging.
I am skilled in building reproducible workflows on high-performance computing systems, integrating R, Python, Linux and Slurm, and conducting simulation studies to validate model performance.

### 🛠 Skills
- **Programming**: R, Python, SQL, HTML, Linux (WSL), MATLAB   
- **Languages**: English (Advanced), Mandarin (Native)
